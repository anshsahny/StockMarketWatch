# StockMarketWatch
This is a basic Stock Market Web App created using Express.js and Node.js, styled with Bootstrap.

A user is able to find out information about a specific stock by searching up the stock ticker symbol located at the top right corner.

The stock data used in this app was through the public IEX Cloud API.
